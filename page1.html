<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Lubaba Khalid, a passionate Data Science student at the University of the Punjab in Lahore, Pakistan. I began my educational journey in a government school, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics and science. I completed my Intermediate in Computer Science (ICS) at a government college, where I discovered my fascination for data analysis and programming.

    Currently, I am honing my skills in data science, learning to extract insights and drive decision-making through the power of data. I enjoy tackling complex problems and am excited about the endless possibilities within this field.
    
    In my spare time, I love exploring new technologies, working on projects, and engaging with the data science community. I’m eager to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on innovative solutions that make a difference.</p>
